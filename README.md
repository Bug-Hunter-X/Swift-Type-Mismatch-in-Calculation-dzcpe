# Swift Type Mismatch in Calculation

This repository demonstrates a common error in Swift: type mismatches in calculations.  The `bug.swift` file shows code that attempts to perform calculations with incompatible types (e.g., multiplying a Double by a String).  This results in a runtime error. The `bugSolution.swift` file shows a corrected version of the code that handles type mismatches gracefully and avoids runtime crashes.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Run the code to see the error and the solution.
